I created a Chrome extension called "Feldman-ifier" that replaces 
all images on any website with random photos of Corey Feldman.

Features:
- Manual swap button to replace all images instantly
- Auto-swap mode that continuously replaces images
- Works on any website

[Download link here]

Installation instructions:
1. Download and extract the zip file
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top-right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked"
5. Select the extracted folder

[Include a screenshot or GIF showing it in action]
